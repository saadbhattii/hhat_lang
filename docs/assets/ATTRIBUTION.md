# Attribution & Asset Licensing

This document describes all third-party visual assets used in the H-hat project.
It covers what each asset is, where it comes from, what license governs it, what
H-hat is and is not allowed to do with it, and what maintainers must do to remain
compliant. This file is intended for both the public and project maintainers.

## Trademark & Ownership Disclaimer

The H-hat logo, browser favicon, and all associated visual icons are **not
registered trademarks** of the H-hat project or any of its contributors.

All visual assets used in H-hat are publicly available icons licensed from
**Flaticon** on a non-exclusive basis. "Non-exclusive" means Flaticon grants
H-hat the right to use these icons, but grants that same right to anyone else
who complies with the same license. H-hat holds no special or exclusive claim
over any of these designs. Any individual or project may independently license
and use the same icons from Flaticon without any conflict with H-hat.

H-hat does not claim that these icons were created by or exclusively for this
project. Full authorship belongs to the original creator, credited below.

## Assets

Both visual assets used in H-hat — the project logo and the browser favicon —
are sourced from the same author and the same icon pack on Flaticon, under the
same license. They are documented separately below for clarity.

## About the Flaticon Free License

Both assets above are governed by the same license. Here is what it means in
plain terms for this project.

### What this license permits

- Free use for both personal and commercial purposes, worldwide.
- Use in websites, software applications, mobile apps, multimedia, printed and
  digital media, advertisements, and presentations.
- Altering the icon and creating derivative works.
- Using an icon as a project logo, provided it is **not officially registered
  as a trademark** with any patent office. H-hat does not register it as such.
- Unlimited use across any and all media for the full duration of the rights.
- The right is **non-exclusive** — the same icons remain available to everyone.

### What this license does not permit

- Sublicensing, selling, or renting the icons or any modified version of them.
- Distributing the icons as standalone downloadable files unless expressly
  authorized by Flaticon.
- Offering the icons or modified versions for download in any form.

### Why using these icons as a logo is permitted

The Flaticon Terms of Use (Section 8.3, point 5) state that Flaticon Content
may not be used as part of a trademark **unless** it is modified enough to
constitute new and distinct content, or unless the use is clearly non-trademark
in nature. H-hat's use is compliant because:

1. The logo is not registered as a trademark in any jurisdiction.
2. H-hat explicitly disclaims exclusive ownership of the design.
3. The same icon is freely available for others to use independently.

## Attribution Requirements

The Flaticon Free License requires attribution. The exact form of that
attribution depends on where the asset appears.

### In this repository (software / application use)

For software and application contexts, the Flaticon license states that
attribution must appear next to the content where possible, or in a credits
or acknowledgements file where it is not. This `ATTRIBUTION.md` file satisfies
that requirement for the repository and the application itself.

Required attribution for both assets:

> Bowler hat icons created by Vitaly Gorbachev – Flaticon

HTML form (for use in interfaces or documentation):

```html
<a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/bowler-hat" title="bowler hat icons">
  Bowler hat icons created by Vitaly Gorbachev - Flaticon
</a>
```

### On the documentation website (web use)

For any web page where either asset appears, the Flaticon free license
explicitly requires a **visible and clickable link** on that page. A credits
file or repository document alone does not satisfy this requirement for web
contexts. The link must be present on the live page itself.

**Required action:** Place the following attribution link in a visible location
on every documentation page where the logo or favicon is displayed. A
site-wide footer covering all pages is the simplest way to comply.

Recommended footer HTML (covers both assets with a single attribution, since
both share the same author and attribution text):

```html
<a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/bowler-hat" title="bowler hat icons">
  Bowler hat icons created by Vitaly Gorbachev - Flaticon
</a>
```

> ⚠️ **Maintainer note:** This link is a legal requirement of the Flaticon
> Free License for all web usage, not an optional courtesy. If the
> documentation site is ever redesigned, migrated, or rebuilt, verify that
> this attribution link is preserved on every page where either asset appears.
> Removing it constitutes a breach of the Flaticon Free License.

## Maintainer Compliance Checklist

| Requirement | Context | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Attribution text in this file | Repository / app | ✅ Present |
| Visible clickable link on documentation site | Web | ⚠️ Must be in site footer |
| Trademark registration | N/A — not registered | ✅ Compliant |
| Trademark disclaimer stated publicly | This file | ✅ Present |
| Icons distributed as standalone downloads | N/A — not distributed | ✅ Compliant |

The only open action item is ensuring the attribution link is implemented in
the documentation site footer before the site goes live.

## What H-hat Does Not Claim

To be fully transparent for any reader — contributor, user, or third party:

- H-hat does **not** claim trademark rights over the bowler hat icon in any
  jurisdiction anywhere in the world.
- H-hat does **not** hold exclusive rights to either of these Flaticon assets.
- H-hat does **not** hold any license beyond the standard Flaticon Free License
  described in this document.
- H-hat did **not** commission these icons. They are pre-existing publicly
  available assets created by Vitaly Gorbachev and hosted on Flaticon.
- Any person or project may independently license and use the same bowler hat
  icons from Flaticon under the same terms without any conflict with H-hat.
